# Huffle

Please note whilst the current version of the language is stable - there is no documentation, and features are minimal (loops, conditionals, I/O + some naitive functions)


Huffle is a programming language made with C++ for building general purpose (and soon HALEX) applications. The language is tree-walk interpreted and high level.  Currently Huffle is in very early development - I will release documentation aswell as new features shortly.
