# About

Huffle is a programming language made for building general purpose (and soon HALEX) applications. Currently it is bare and unoptimised- but features most major programming constructs, and is turing complete. These include:

- For & While loops
- Conditionals
- Functions (naitive and user defined)
- I/O
- Type conversions
- Arithmetic and logical evaluation
- Variables


# Roadmap

Huffle still has a long way to go before becoming a fully fledged and useful langauge. In the future I plan to use it as part of HALEX web infastructure - a sort of internet clone I am working on, but for now this repo has simply the core language features along with core graphics functionality. Here are more immenent plans:

- Add arrays + potentially other containers
- Improve error reporting
- Add basic GUI controls (via SFML)
- Add module system for file inclusion
- Build up standard library with more naitive functions
- Improve type system

I will update this as the project progresses.
